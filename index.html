			  <h1>Article: Woman in society</h1>
				<p>
				   American Housewife, Helen Ellis’ critically acclaimed, darkly comic, collection of short stories, is the latest addition to the conversation about domestic life. The book was born from Ellis’ anonymous Twitter account @WhatIDoAllDay – a question she and many other women who manage a home often get asked. “Helen Ellis Is Giving Housewives a Very Good Name,” says Vogue.
                 (She is also a passionate poker player who paid off her student debt with her winnings in the World Series of Poker.)
                  For years, women have been told they need to “have it all,” but the conversation about homemaking seems to be shifting. It seems that as life gets busier, we as a society are starting to place more value on the domestic arts. It’s a great thing.
                  Homemaker blogs and social media accounts like Naomi Davis’ Love Taza are attracting massive followings. It’s part of return to appreciating the simple things – family, food and a beautiful home.
                  This trend is a welcome antidote to the Real Housewives TV shows and negative stereotype associated with women who stay at home.
                 “My idea of old-school housewifery is I Love Lucy. I live in an apartment, I cook and I clean. I see friends. I see my husband,” Ellis told the Globe and Mail. It’s what she calls “a quiet 1950s life.”
                  Of course, as housewives know, life at home isn’t always quiet and is often lot of work. The average non-working housewife in the US in 2014 spent 94 hours a week working at jobs in the home that would earn a salary of $113,568 according to Salary.com.
